The year of stress and crazy is over and I wanted to get back to working on this blog. I refreshed the theme with something simpler and updated the pipeline... Now I just need to write some content.

And getting back to the original purpose of this blog was to document whatever I'm working on and share it with whomever might be struggling similar issues.

### My current TODO list:

- Renew my AWS Solutions Architect - professional certification. (I do realize it's ironic that I didn't get this done last year while I was working there)
- Start work on studying for a security related certification. I'm not sure if this will be AWS or some other cert.
- Find a opensource project to contribute to. I'm thinking maybe [homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) or maybe get crazy and learn go to help with [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- Figure out what to do with my mailserver. Currently it's running on [mailcow](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized) which is great but I'm wondering if it's overkill for what my family needs also it's a bit of a pig and uses a lot of resources
- Learn how to really use VIM. A couple months ago I was watching one of my engineers use VIM and he was so fast. I was convicted that I should really learn this tool as I use it (poorly) every week.
