        <p>The year of stress and crazy is over and I wanted to get back to working on this blog. I refreshed the theme with something simpler and updated the pipeline... Now I just need to write some content.</p>

        <p>And getting back to the original purpose of this blog was to document whatever I'm working on and share it with whomever might be struggling similar issues.</p>

        <h3>My current TODO list:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Renew my AWS Solutions Architect - professional certification. (I do realize it's ironic that I didn't get this done last year while I was working there)</li>
          <li>Start work on studying for a security related certification. I'm not sure if this will be AWS or some other cert.</li>
          <li>Find a opensource project to contribute to. I'm thinking maybe <a href="https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge">homebridge</a> or maybe get crazy and learn go to help with <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hugo</a></li>
          <li>Figure out what to do with my mailserver. Currently it's running on <a href="https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized">mailcow</a> which is great but I'm wondering if it's overkill for what my family needs also it's a bit of a pig and uses a lot of resources</li>
          <li>Learn how to really use VIM. A couple months ago I was watching one of my engineers use VIM and he was so fast. I was convicted that I should really learn this tool as I use it (poorly) every week.</li>
        </ul>
