<h2>Who am I...</h2>
<p>Good question, I'm an IT professional who's worked in the industry for over 20 years. I've done everything from desktop support to server administration to software development and now I'm a engineering manager.</p>

<h2>Why another blog?</h2>
<p>The point of this blog was to help document the stuff I'm working on so I remember what I've worked on. It's really easy to fix a problem and move on to the next one. I've enjoyed looking back through my notes on what I've done and I thought I'd post it on the net in hopes that it may help someone else.</p>
<p>So content wise there will be a lot about cloud, homelab, running and whatever else I find interesting.</p>

<h2>Other stuff outside of computers</h2>
<p>So yes I'm a nerd but I like to do other stuff. I've picked up running about 8 years ago and enjoy getting out at least a few times a week to enjoy the outdoors. I have also gotten back into hiking, as one should when you live in such a beautiful area.</p>
