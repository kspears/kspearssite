## Who am I...
Good question, I'm an IT professional who's worked in the industry for over 20 years. I've done everything from desktop support to server administration to software development and now I'm a engineering manager. 

## Why another blog?
The point of this blog was to help document the stuff I'm working on so I remember what I've worked on. It's really easy to fix a problem and move on to the next one. I've enjoyed looking back through my notes on what I've done and I thought I'd post it on the net in hopes that it may help someone else.

So content wise there will be a lot about cloud, homelab, running and whatever else I find interesting.

## Other stuff outside of computers
So yes I'm a nerd but I like to do other stuff. I've picked up running about 8 years ago and enjoy getting out at least a few times a week to enjoy the outdoors. I have also gotten back into hiking, as one should when you live in such a beautiful area.
