One of the things I didn't know about when I began running and shopping for shoes is a small but crucial factor: heel dropâ€”the difference in height between the heel and forefoot. While traditional running shoes often have aÂ higher heel drop (10-12mm), lower-drop shoes (0-6mm) are gaining popularity among runners. But isÂ less heel drop better? Letâ€™s break it down.

## What Is Heel Drop?

Heel drop, orÂ heel-to-toe offset, measures how much theÂ heel sits higher than the forefootÂ in a running shoe.

- High-drop shoes (10-12mm):Â Promote heel striking and more cushioning in the heel.

- Mid-drop shoes (5-8mm):Â Offer a balance between heel and forefoot cushioning.

- Low-drop shoes (0-4mm):Â Encourage a more natural foot strike.

- Zero-drop shoes (0mm):Â Keep the heel and forefoot level, mimicking barefoot movement.

## Why Less Heel Drop Is Better for Runners

### 1.Â Encourages a Natural Running Gait

A lower heel drop promotesÂ midfoot or forefoot striking, reducing impact forces on the knees and encouraging a more efficient stride. This isÂ closer to how humans naturally run barefoot, minimizing excess stress on joints.\

### 2.Â Reduces Risk of Knee Injuries

Studies suggestÂ high-heel-drop shoes increase impact on the knees, which can contribute to conditions like runnerâ€™s knee and IT band syndrome. Lower-drop shoes shift some of the load to theÂ calves and ankles, distributing stress more evenly. Higher-drop shoes were linked toÂ increased patellofemoral stress, a key factor in knee pain among runners (Bonacci et al., 2013).

### 3.Â Strengthens Feet and Lower Legs

Low-drop shoesÂ engage foot muscles, Achilles tendons, and calves more actively, helping to build strength over time. This can improve overall running efficiency and reduce reliance on thick, cushioned footwear.

### 4.Â Better Ground Feel and Stability

A lower heel drop improvesÂ proprioception, or the ability to sense and adjust to terrain changes. This can lead to better balance, more responsive running, and a lower risk of ankle rollsâ€”especially for trail runners.

### 5.Â Enhances Running Efficiency

By promoting aÂ natural stride and engaging key muscles, low-drop shoes may improve running economy, reducing wasted energy and allowing for a moreÂ fluid, powerfulÂ movement.

Best Low and Zero-Drop Running Shoe Brands

### AltraÂ â€“ The Leader in Zero-Drop Shoes

Altra is known for itsÂ fully zero-drop design, allowing for the most natural foot positioning possible. Their shoes also feature aÂ wide toe box, encouraging natural toe splay and comfort.

#### Top Picks:

- Altra EscalanteÂ â€“ Great for road runners who want a soft yet responsive ride.

- Altra Lone PeakÂ â€“ A favorite among trail runners, offering durability and grip.

- Altra TorinÂ â€“ A cushioned zero-drop option for long-distance runners.

### HokaÂ â€“ Low-Drop with Max Cushioning

Hoka offersÂ low-drop shoes (4-5mm)Â withÂ high cushioning, making them a great option for those transitioning from higher-drop shoes.

#### Top Picks:

- Hoka CliftonÂ â€“ A soft, lightweight daily trainer with a 5mm drop.

- Hoka SpeedgoatÂ â€“ Ideal for trail runners who want grip and cushion.

- Hoka MachÂ â€“ A responsive, fast shoe with a low 5mm drop.

## Transitioning to a Lower Heel Drop Safely

Switching from a high-drop to a low-drop shoeÂ requires patienceÂ to avoid injury. Hereâ€™s how to transition safely:

- Start graduallyÂ â€“ Begin with short runs in lower-drop shoes to allow muscles and tendons to adapt.

- Strengthen your calvesÂ â€“ Since lower-drop shoes put more stress on the Achilles and calves, add calf raises and mobility exercises to your routine.

- Listen to your bodyÂ â€“ Soreness is normal, but sharp pain is a red flag. Adjust your mileage as needed.

- Rotate shoesÂ â€“ Use a mix of different heel drops to prevent overuse injuries.

## Should You Go Zero Drop?

WhileÂ zero-drop shoesÂ can offer the most natural running experience, theyâ€™re not for everyone. Runners withÂ stiff ankles, past Achilles injuries, or a history of calf issuesÂ may prefer a slight drop (4-6mm) for added comfort.

## Final Thoughts

Lower heel-drop running shoes promoteÂ natural movement, reduce knee stress, strengthen muscles, and improve efficiency. I personally have chosen to run in Altra Lone Peak on the trails and Hoka Cliftons on the road. Whether you goÂ zero-drop with AltraÂ or prefer theÂ low-drop cushioning of Hoka, choosing the right shoe can help youÂ run stronger, stay injury-free, and feel more connected to the ground.
