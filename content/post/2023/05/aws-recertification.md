I had let my AWS Solution Architect Professional certification expire as I didn't have a lot of spare time during my previous role. So I figured now with my surplus of time I would work on renewing it. 

## A Cloud Guru
For all my AWS certifications so far I had used [A Cloud Guru](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru) and it worked alright for me so I decided to use their service again this time around. Pluralsight bought them / merged with them sometime in the past few years so they are working on combining the two services. My time training was caught in the middle of this merging of my course which is understandable but also unfortunate as it would be confusing when I would log in and see that they had added new videos or modified quizzes and tests.

The video content was pretty good. If you have any experience or have taken the associates level test then some of the content will be familiar to you but don't skip too much of the videos. I would find little nuggets of information that were helpful on the quizzes.
The challenges are good brain problems, trying to figure out in your head how you'd respond to a scenario. The demos and labs were ok, some of them I felt were too easy or not detailed enough to really provide help in my training but your milage may vary.

## My Tips
- A Cloud Guru / Pluralsight offer a playground, use it. Play with all the things you are learning. There are only a few exceptions that you aren't able to create in the playground, like multi account setups that centralize permissions and logging.
- Have your own account to play in, there's nothing like actually building and supporting your own blog or whatever. (I run a mailsesrver).
- Give yourself lots of time, don't set your test date too early. But also don't procrastinate. 

## Good Luck!
I plan to take the test next month, I'm wrapping up training over the next few weeks. I hope you found this post helpful and encouraging!
